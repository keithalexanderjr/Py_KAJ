TripPlanner V1.0.

Create a function called trip_planner_welcome() that takes one parameter called name. The function should use print() to output a message like this:
 
 
Welcome to tripplanner v1.0 <Name Here>
Where <Name Here> represents the parameter variable of name we defined.
Call trip_planner_welcome(), passing your name as an argument.
 
Part II

Next, we are going to define a function called estimated_time_rounded() that will allow us to calculate a rounded time value based on a decimal for our userâ€™s trip.

An example call for this function will look like this:
 
estimated_time_rounded(2.5)

[Where 2 represents 2 hours and .5 represents 30 minutes.]

Define the function estimated_time_rounded() with a single parameter estimated_time. The function should do two things:
Create a variable called rounded_time that is the result of calling the round() built-in function on the parameter estimated_time.
Return rounded_time.

After the function definition, call estimated_time_rounded() with a decimal argument and save the result to a variable called estimate. Since this amount represents a time, be sure to use a positive number.
 
We have successfully finished our first version of the trip builder application. Test passing different values into functions located: trip_planner_kaj
